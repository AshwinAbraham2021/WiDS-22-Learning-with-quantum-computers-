# Learning with quantum computers
This is the repository for the project "Learning with quantum computers" as a part of Winter in Data Science (WiDS) 2022 at IIT Bombay.

## Weekwise Plan 

This project will be four weeks long. The breif week-wise breakdown is as follows, 

1. _Week One_: Here, you will spend time on learning and/or brushing up on the basic theory of quantum computing. The primary text will be the [book by Nielson and Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf). 
2. _Week Two_: Herein, you will concern yourself with the theory and implementation of various algorithms. This will also serve as practice in two popular quantum libraries, viz. [IBM's Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and [Xanadu's Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/). 
3 _Week Three_: This week will involve a quick brush-up of ML theory, and reading of QML theory. For the latter, refer to chapter 6 of [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09510.pdf) paper, and [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3097.pdf) paper. Also, start reading through the [pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) documentation.
4 _Week Four_: In this week, you have to conduct some independent work in your choice of subfield in QML. This could include finding a paper and implementing it, conducting a thorough survey of some particularly intersting quantum learning or optimization algorithm possibly with implementation (QAOA would be a good target for this) or trying to research into some fundamentals of QML (for instance, what should be the basic learning unit -- what is to QML that the neuron is to classical ML?). 

**Note**
- At the end of week three, you will be given a simple assignment which will test your implementation skills. Submitting this is necessary for completion of the project. 
- Though not compulsary, we would suggest writing all of your work (week 1-4) up in a brief report (3-4) pages in LaTeX. This is perhaps compulsary for those who choose to do a literature review in week four.
