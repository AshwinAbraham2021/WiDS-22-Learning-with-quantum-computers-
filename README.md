# Learning with Quantum Computers
This is the repository for the project "Learning with Quantum Computers" as a part of Winter in Data Science (WiDS) 2022 at IIT Bombay.

## Weekwise Plan 

This project will be four weeks long. The brief week-wise breakdown is as follows, 

1. **Week One**: Here, you will spend time on learning and/or brushing up on the basic theory of Quantum Computing. The primary text will be the [book by Nielsen and Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf). For the different sub-projects, the alloted reading is as follows, 

  - _QML Implementation_ 
    * Necessary: 
      * Chapter 2 (upto and including section 2.2)
      * Chapter 4 (upto and including section 4.6)

    * Optional: 
      * Rest of Chapter 2
      * Chapter 5, 6

  - _QML Literature Review_ 
    * Necessary: Chapter 2, 4, 5, 6
    * Optional: Chapter 8 (Quantum Operations), 9 (Distance Measures)

  - _QRL (both)_
    * Necessary: Chapter 2, 4, 5, 6 (for mentees doing the literature review, chapter 8 might also be useful) 

**Note**
Note that for the completion of the WiDS project, a report is necessary. While the report format is up to you, we recommend writing the report using LaTeX. This can essentially be where you note down things which you do on a weekly basis. For the lit review people, this report should preferably be in a paper format (for instance, [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), or [APS REVTeX](https://journals.aps.org/revtex/revtex-faq#u1)).
