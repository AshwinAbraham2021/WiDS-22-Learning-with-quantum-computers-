# Learning with quantum computers
This is the repository for the project "Learning with quantum computers" as a part of Winter in Data Science (WiDS) 2022 at IIT Bombay.

## Weekwise Plan 

This project will be four weeks long. The breif week-wise breakdown is as follows, 

1. **Week One**: Here, you will spend time on learning and/or brushing up on the basic theory of quantum computing. The primary text will be the [book by Nielson and Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf). For the different sub-projects, the alloted reading is as follows, 

  - <ins>QML Implementation</ins> Necessary things: Chapter 2 (upto and including section 2.2), Chapter 4 (upto and   including section 4.6). Optional: Rest of Chapter 2, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.
  - <ins>QML Lit Review</ins> Necessary things: Chapter 2,4,5,6. Optional: Learn quantum operations and quantum       distance measures (chapter 8 and chapter 9) 
  - <ins>QRL (both)</ins> Necessary things: Chapter 2,4,5,6. For lit review people: Going to chapter 8 stuff might     be helpful as we go along, but not now.



**Note**
- Note that for the completion of the WiDS project, a report is necessary. Now, while the format of the same is up to you, we recommend writing the report using LaTeX. This can essentially be where you note down things which you do on a weekly basis. For the lit review people, this report should preferably be in a paper format (for instance, [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), or [APS REVTeX](https://journals.aps.org/revtex/revtex-faq#u1)). Other people can also follow this.
